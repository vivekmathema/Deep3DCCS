Rotation-specific datasets are generated by changing the “Xrot” label in the filename and selecting the same rotation value (e.g., 5rot) in the software. The RAW CSV/XLS files remain identical; only the software’s processing differs.

A single RAW dataset per adduct can generate all rotation variants. Separate datasets are provided here only for demonstration. Based on the selected 2D projection configuration, the software automatically generates the corresponding 3D dataset and 2D projections.

Optional: An identical Microsoft XLS file is included for better annotation and customization of the input data.

Users are expected to extract the CSV/XLS files to the ./datasets/ folder
